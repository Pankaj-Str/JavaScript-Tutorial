# 2. JavaScript Variables
***

**Example 1: Declaring and Assigning Variables**

```javascript
// Using 'let' to declare and assign a variable
let name = "John";
let age = 30;

// Using 'const' for a constant variable
const pi = 3.14;
```

In this example, we declare a variable named `name` and assign the string value "John" to it. We also declare a variable `age` and assign the number 30 to it. The `const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable `pi` with a value of 3.14, which cannot be reassigned.

**Example 2: Updating Variables**
```javascript
let count = 5;
count = count + 1; // Updating the 'count' variable
```

Here, we declare a variable `count` with an initial value of 5. We then update the variable's value by adding 1 to it.

**Example 3: Data Types**
```javascript
let message = "Hello, world!";
let isRaining = true;
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
```

In this example, we declare variables with different data types:
- `message` is a string.
- `isRaining` is a boolean.
- `numbers` is an array.
- `person` is an object.

**Example 4: Variable Naming and Scope**
```javascript
let globalVar = "I'm global";

function exampleScope() {
  let localVar = "I'm local";
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible inside the function
  console.log(localVar);  // Accessible within the function
}

console.log(globalVar); // Accessible globally
// console.log(localVar);  // Results in an error - 'localVar' is not defined outside the function
```

In this example, we declare two variables: `globalVar` and `localVar`. `globalVar` is declared in the global scope and can be accessed both inside and outside the function. `localVar` is declared within the `exampleScope` function and is only accessible within that function, demonstrating the concept of variable scope.

**Example 5: Hoisting**
```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined (hoisted but not initialized)
var x = 5;

// console.log(y); // ReferenceError (let and const are not hoisted)
let y = 10;
```

In this example, the `var` variable `x` is hoisted to the top of the current scope, but it's not initialized yet, so it's `undefined`. The `let` variable `y` is not hoisted, and attempting to access it before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

These examples illustrate how to declare, assign, and use variables in JavaScript, covering various data types, scoping, and hoisting. Understanding these concepts is essential for working with variables effectively in JavaScript.
