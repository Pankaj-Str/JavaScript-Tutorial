# 13. while Loop

## JavaScript While Loops

A "while" loop in JavaScript is a control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. It's a way to create loops that are based on the evaluation of a condition. While the condition is true, the loop will keep executing.

### Syntax:

```javascript
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
```

- `condition`: This is the expression that is evaluated before each iteration. If it's true, the code inside the `while` loop will execute. If the condition becomes false, the loop terminates.

### How It Works:

1. The `condition` is evaluated before the loop starts. If the condition is initially false, the loop won't execute at all.

2. If the `condition` is true, the code block inside the `while` loop is executed.

3. After the code block executes, the `condition` is re-evaluated.

4. If the `condition` remains true, the loop will continue to execute. This process repeats until the `condition` becomes false.

5. When the `condition` becomes false, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the code after the `while` loop.

### Example 1: Countdown
In this example, we use a `while` loop to count down from 5 to 1.

```javascript
let count = 5;
while (count >= 1) {
    console.log(count);
    count--;
}
```

Output:
```
5
4
3
2
1
```

### Example 2: Sum of Numbers
Let's calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

```javascript
let sum = 0;
let number = 1;
while (number <= 10) {
    sum += number;
    number++;
}
console.log("The sum is: " + sum);
```

Output:
```
The sum is: 55
```

### Example 3: User Input
Here, we use a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until they enter "exit."

```javascript
let userInput;
while (userInput !== "exit") {
    userInput = prompt("Enter a value (or type 'exit' to quit):");
}
```

In this example, the loop continues to ask for input until the user enters "exit."

### Example 4: Infinite Loop
Be cautious when using `while` loops to avoid creating infinite loops. If the condition is never met, the loop will run indefinitely. For example:

```javascript
while (true) {
    console.log("This is an infinite loop!");
}
```

To break out of an infinite loop or any `while` loop, you can use the `break` statement.

JavaScript's `while` loop is a fundamental tool for creating loops that execute based on a condition. It's useful for tasks where you don't know the exact number of iterations in advance or when you need to repeatedly perform an action until a certain condition is met.


## Infinite Loop Example
```js
while (1 < 5) {
    console.log("Learning while loop.");
    console.log("JavaScript is fun.");
}
```
**Output**
```
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
............
```

## while Example 1
```js
let count = 1;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log("Learning while loop.");
    console.log("JavaScript is fun.");
    count = count + 1;
}
```
**Output**
```
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.
```

## while loop Example 2
```js
let count = 1;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log("Learning while loop.");
    console.log("JavaScript is fun.");
    console.log(count);
    count = count + 1;   
}
```
**Output**
```
Learning while loop.
JavaScript is fun.

## Creating Multiplication Table
```js
const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "));
let count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
    const product = number * count;
    console.log(product);
    count = count + 1;
}
```
**Output**
```
Enter a number: 9
9
18
27
36
45
54
63
72
81
90
```
***
## Useful Output Message
```js
const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "));
let count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
    const product = number * count;
    console.log(`${number} * ${count} = ${product}`);
    count = count + 1;
}
```
**Output**
```
Enter a number: 9
9 * 1 = 9
9 * 2 = 18
9 * 3 = 27
9 * 4 = 36
9 * 5 = 45
9 * 6 = 54
9 * 7 = 63
9 * 8 = 72
9 * 9 = 81
9 * 10 = 90
```

## do While Loop
### Example 1
```js
let count = 1;
do {
    console.log(count);
    count = count + 1;
} while (count < 5)
```
**Output**
```
1
2
3
4
```

## Assignment and Task
**Can you use the while loop to print the multiplication table for the given number. But this time, you have to print the number from 10 to 1. So the output would be something like this.**
```js
9 * 10 = 90
9 * 9 = 81
9 * 8 = 72
9 * 7 = 63
9 * 6 = 54
9 * 5 = 45
9 * 4 = 36
9 * 3 = 27
9 * 2 = 18
9 * 1 = 9
```
### Solution:
```js
const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "));
let count = 10;
while (count >= 1) {
    const product = number * count;
    console.log(`${number} * ${count} = ${product}`);
    count = count - 1;
}
```
**Output**
```
Enter a number: 9
9 * 10 = 90
9 * 9 = 81
9 * 8 = 72
9 * 7 = 63
9 * 6 = 54
9 * 5 = 45
9 * 4 = 36
9 * 3 = 27
9 * 2 = 18
9 * 1 = 9
```
