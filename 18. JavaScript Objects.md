# JavaScript Objects

JavaScript objects are a fundamental data structure that allows you to store and manipulate data as key-value pairs. Objects are versatile and are used to represent and organize data in a structured way. They are at the core of the JavaScript language and are used for a wide range of purposes.

Here's an overview of JavaScript objects, including their syntax, properties, methods, and examples:

## Creating Objects

In JavaScript, objects can be created in several ways:

### 1. Object Literal
The simplest way to create an object is using object literal notation:

```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false
};
```

### 2. Object Constructor
You can also create objects using the `Object` constructor:

```javascript
const car = new Object();
car.make = "Toyota";
car.model = "Camry";
car.year = 2020;
```

### 3. Object.create() Method
The `Object.create()` method allows you to create a new object with the specified prototype object:

```javascript
const animal = {
    type: "Mammal",
    sound: "Roar"
};

const lion = Object.create(animal);
lion.name = "Simba";
```

## Accessing Object Properties

You can access object properties using dot notation or bracket notation:

```javascript
console.log(person.firstName); // "John"
console.log(car["make"]); // "Toyota"
```

## Modifying Object Properties

You can change the values of object properties by assigning new values:

```javascript
person.age = 31;
car["year"] = 2022;
```

## Adding New Properties

You can add new properties to an object:

```javascript
person.city = "New York";
car.color = "Blue";
```

## Deleting Properties

You can delete properties from an object using the `delete` operator:

```javascript
delete person.isStudent;
delete car["model"];
```

## Object Methods

Objects can also contain methods, which are functions defined as object properties. Methods allow you to define actions or behaviors associated with an object:

```javascript
const calculator = {
    add: function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    },
    subtract: function(a, b) {
        return a - b;
    }
};

console.log(calculator.add(5, 3)); // 8
console.log(calculator.subtract(8, 2)); // 6
```

## Object Properties and Methods

JavaScript objects can contain a combination of properties and methods:

```javascript
const student = {
    firstName: "Alice",
    lastName: "Smith",
    age: 20,
    greet: function() {
        console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}.`);
    }
};

student.greet(); // "Hello, I'm Alice Smith."
```

## Object Iteration

You can loop through object properties using a `for...in` loop or the `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` methods:

```javascript
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key, person[key]);
}

const keys = Object.keys(person);
const values = Object.values(person);
const entries = Object.entries(person);
```

JavaScript objects are a powerful and flexible way to store and manipulate data in your programs. They are used extensively in web development for representing various entities, such as data structures, configurations, and more. Understanding how to work with objects is essential for effective JavaScript programming.

```js
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 20,
};
console.log(person);
```
**Output**
```
{name: "John", age: 20}
```

## To find Type
```js
const person = { 
    name: "John",
    age: 20,
};
console.log(person);
console.log(typeof(person));
```
**Output**
```
{name: "John", age: 20}
object
```
## Accessing Object Properties

### Using dot notation
```js
const person = { 
    name: "John", 
    age: 20,
};
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person.age);
```
**Output**
```
John
20
```
## Change the value of an object
```js
const person = { 
    name: "John", 
    age: 20,
    student: true
};
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person.age);

person.age = 29;
console.log(person.age);
```
**Output**
```
John
20
29
```
### Using bracket notation
```js
const person = { 
    name: "John", 
    age: 20,
};
console.log(person["name"]);
console.log(person["age"]);
```
**Output**
```
John
20
```
## Object Methods
```js
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    greet: function() { console.log('hello') }
}
person.greet();
```
**Output**
```
hello
```

## Assignment and Task
**Can you create an object named student with keys name, rollNo, totalMarks. Give any values you prefer.
Also, create two functions: first function to print the information about the student and a second function to check if the student passed the exam or not. If the totalMarks is  less than 40, print 'You failed'. If the totalMarks is greater than or equal to 40, print 'You passed'.**
### Solution:
```js
const student = {
    name: 'Jack',
    rollNo: 12,
    total_marks : 40
}

function studentInfo() {
    console.log(student.name);
    console.log(student.rollNo);
    console.log(student.total_marks);
}

function checkResult() {
    if (student.total_marks < 40) {
        console.log('You failed.')
    } else {
        console.log('You passed.')
    }
}

studentInfo();
checkResult();
```

**Output**
```
Jack
12
40
You passed.
```
