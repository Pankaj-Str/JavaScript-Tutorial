# for...in and for...of Loop


### `for...in` Loop

The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object, such as object keys. It is commonly used with objects and can also be used with arrays (although it's generally not recommended for arrays). Here's how it works:

#### Syntax:

```javascript
for (variable in object) {
    // code to be executed for each property
}
```

- `variable`: A variable that represents the current property key in each iteration.
- `object`: The object you want to iterate over.

#### Example with an Object:

```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30
};

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
```

Output:
```
firstName: John
lastName: Doe
age: 30
```

In this example, the `for...in` loop iterates over the keys of the `person` object, and we use the `key` variable to access each property's value.

#### Example with an Array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let index in numbers) {
    console.log(index + ": " + numbers[index]);
}
```

Output:
```
0: 1
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
4: 5
```

In this example, the `for...in` loop iterates over the indices of the `numbers` array. While it works for arrays, it's usually better to use the `for...of` loop for iterating over array elements.

### `for...of` Loop

The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the values of iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, and other iterable data structures. It's more concise and is the preferred choice for iterating over array elements. Here's how it works:

#### Syntax:

```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
    // code to be executed for each value
}
```

- `variable`: A variable that represents the current value in each iteration.
- `iterable`: An iterable object (e.g., an array or string).

#### Example with an Array:

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

for (let color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
```

Output:
```
red
green
blue
```

In this example, the `for...of` loop iterates over the values in the `colors` array, and we use the `color` variable to access each element directly.

#### Example with a String:

```javascript
const text = "Hello";

for (let char of text) {
    console.log(char);
}
```

Output:
```
H
e
l
l
o
```

In this example, the `for...of` loop iterates over the characters in the `text` string.

### Key Differences:

- `for...in` is used for iterating over object properties (keys).
- `for...of` is used for iterating over the values of iterable objects (arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.).
- `for...of` is more concise and is generally preferred for iterating over array elements.
- `for...in` can introduce unexpected behavior when used with arrays due to its iteration of keys.

In summary, `for...in` and `for...of` loops serve different purposes in JavaScript. Use `for...in` for object property iteration and `for...of` for iterating over iterable values, particularly when working with arrays.

## JavaScript for...of loop
**Example 1**
```js
const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 9];

for (const element of numbers) {
  console.log(element);
}
```
**Output**
```
1
3
5
9
```
***
**Example 2**
```js
const members = ['John', 'Sara', 'Jack'];
 
for (const name of members) {
  let fullname = name + ' ' + 'Smith';
  console.log(fullname);
}
```
**Output**
```
John Smith
Sara Smith
Jack Smith
```
## for...of with strings
```js
const name = 'Programiz';

for (let i of name) {
    console.log(i);
}
```
**Output**
```
P
r
o
g
r
a
m
i
z
```

## JavaScript for...in loop
**Example 1**
```js
const student = {
    name: 'Monica',
    class: 7,
    age: 12
};

console.log(student);
```
**Output**
```
{ name: 'Monica', class: 7, age: 12 }
```
***
**Example 2**
```js
const student = {
    name: 'Monica',
    class: 7,
    age: 12
}

for (let key in student) {
  console.log(key);
}
```
**Output**
```
name
class
age
```
**Example 3**
```js
const student = {
    name: 'Monica',
    class: 7,
    age: 12
}

for (let key in student) {
  let value = student[key];
  console.log(`${key} => ${value}`);
}
```
**Output**
```
name => Monica
class => 7
age => 12
```
## Change Object values using for...in
```js
const employee = {
    Jack: 24000,
    Paul: 34000,
    Monica: 32000
}

for (let i in employee) {
  let salary = employee[i] + 5000;
  console.log(`${i} : ${salary}`);
}
```
**Output**
```
Jack : 29000
Paul : 39000
Monica : 37000
```
## Assignment and Task
**Create an array named names with values: "jack", "rosie", "mira".
Now, use a for...of loop to print each name of the array.
However, while printing the name, change the first character to uppercase.**
### Solution:
```js
const names = ['jack', 'rosie', 'mira'];
for (let element of names) {
    const result = element.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + element.slice(1);
    console.log(result);
}
```
**Output**
```
"Jack"
"Rosie"
"Mira"
```

**Q. What is the output of the program?**
```js
const student = {
    name: 'Monica',
    class: 7,
    age: 12
}

for ( let key of student ) {
    console.log(`${key} => ${student[key]}`);
}
```
1. Error
2. name => Monica
class => 7
age => 12
3. name => name
class => class
age => age
4. Monica => Monica
7 => 7
12 => 12

Answer: 3
