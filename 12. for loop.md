# 12. for loop

A `for` loop is a control structure in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code a specified number of times or for a specific range of values. It is commonly used when you need to iterate over a collection (like an array) or when you want to execute a block of code a certain number of times. The basic syntax of a `for` loop is as follows:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

Here's a breakdown of how a `for` loop works:

1. **Initialization**: This part is executed once at the beginning of the loop. It typically initializes a loop counter variable, setting its initial value.

2. **Condition**: The loop will continue executing as long as this condition is `true`. If the condition is `false` at the beginning, the loop's body will not execute at all, and the loop will terminate.

3. **Increment/Decrement**: After each iteration of the loop's body, this part is executed to modify the loop counter variable. It is used to control the progression of the loop and eventually make the condition `false`.

4. **Loop Body**: The code inside the loop body is executed in each iteration as long as the condition is `true`.

Here are some examples of `for` loops:

### Example 1: Looping a Specific Number of Times
This loop will print numbers from 1 to 5.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

## for loop Example
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log("Learning for loop.");
    console.log("JavaScript is fun.");

    console.log(i);
}
```
**Output**
```
Learning for loop.
JavaScript is fun.
1
Learning for loop.
JavaScript is fun.
2
Learning for loop.
JavaScript is fun.
3
Learning for loop.
JavaScript is fun.
4
Learning for loop.
JavaScript is fun.

## Creating Multiplication Table
```js
const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "));
for (let count = 1; count <= 10; count++) {
    const product = number * count;
    console.log(`${number} * ${count} = ${product}`);
}
```
**Output**
```
Enter a number: 9
9 * 1 = 9
9 * 2 = 18
9 * 3 = 27
9 * 4 = 36
9 * 5 = 45
9 * 6 = 54
9 * 7 = 63
9 * 8 = 72
9 * 9 = 81
9 * 10 = 90
```

## for...in Loop Example
```js
const student = {
    name: 'Monica',
    class: 7,
    age: 12
}

for ( let data in student ) {
    console.log(`${data} => ${student[data]}`);
}
```
**Output**
```
name => Monica
class => 7
age => 12
```
***
## for of loop
```js
const students = ['John', 'Sara', 'Jack'];
for ( let data of students) {
    console.log(data);
}
```
**Output**
```
John
Sara
Jack
```
***
### Get Character
```js
let language = "JavaScript";
for (let character of language) {
    console.log(character);
}
```
**Output**
```
J
a
v
a
S
c
r
i
p
t
```
## Assignment and Task
**Can you use the for loop to print all the even numbers from 1 to 100. So the output would be something like this.**
```js
2
4
6
8
10
12
........
```
### Solution:
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if(i % 2 == 0) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```
**Output**
```
