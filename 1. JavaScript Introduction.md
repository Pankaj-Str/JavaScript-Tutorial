# 1- Getting Started With JavaScript
***
JavaScript is not something you need to install separately like a software program; it's already built into modern web browsers. To create and run a basic JavaScript program, you only need a text editor and a web browser. Here's a simple guide to creating your first JavaScript program:

1. **Text Editor:**
   Choose a text editor to write your JavaScript code. You can use popular text editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++, or even a plain text editor like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS.

2. **Create an HTML File:**
   Create an HTML file where you'll include your JavaScript code. You can do this by opening your text editor and creating a new file with a ".html" extension. For example, you can name it `index.html`.

3. **Write the HTML Structure:**
   In your `index.html` file, write the basic structure of an HTML document, including an opening and closing `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Here's a simple example:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My First JavaScript Program</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <!-- Your JavaScript code will go here -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. **Adding JavaScript Code:**
   Inside the `<body>` section of your HTML file, you can include JavaScript code within `<script>` tags. You can place the `<script>` tags in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>` section. Here's an example of adding a basic JavaScript program that displays a message:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My First JavaScript Program</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <script>
           // Your JavaScript code goes here
           alert('Hello, JavaScript!');
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

5. **Save the File:**
   Save your `index.html` file after adding the JavaScript code.

6. **Open in a Web Browser:**
   Locate your `index.html` file and open it with your preferred web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge). You should see an alert message saying "Hello, JavaScript!"

That's it! You've created and executed a basic JavaScript program in an HTML document. As you continue to learn JavaScript, you can add more complex code and interact with the HTML document's content and structure. You can also link external JavaScript files and build interactive web applications as you become more proficient.
