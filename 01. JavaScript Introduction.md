# : Running Your First "Hello, World!" Program

This tutorial walks you through creating and running a "Hello, World!" program in JavaScript, designed for absolute beginners. We’ll cover two methods: running JavaScript in a web browser and using Node.js. Each step is detailed to ensure clarity.

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. It runs in browsers (e.g., Chrome) and can also work outside browsers with Node.js. This tutorial focuses on writing and running a simple program that outputs "Hello, World!".

## Prerequisites
- A computer with a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome).
- A text editor (Notepad is fine, but Visual Studio Code is recommended—free at [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- Optional: Node.js (we’ll guide you through installation for Method 2).
- No coding experience needed.

## Method 1: Running "Hello, World!" in a Web Browser
This method uses a browser to run JavaScript, displaying the output in the browser’s console.

### Step 1: Create a New File
1. Open your text editor (e.g., Notepad or VS Code).
2. Create a new file and name it `index.html`. Save it in a folder, like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\JS_Tutorial`.

### Step 2: Write the HTML and JavaScript Code
1. Copy and paste the following code into `index.html`:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <title>My First JavaScript Program</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World! Program</h1>
       <script>
           console.log("Hello, World!");
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
2. Save the file (`Ctrl+S` or `File > Save`).

**What’s happening here?**
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the file as HTML.
- `<script>`: Contains JavaScript code.
- `console.log("Hello, World!");`: Prints "Hello, World!" to the browser’s console.

### Step 3: Open the File in a Browser
1. Navigate to your folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\JS_Tutorial`).
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser, or drag the file into an open browser window (e.g., Chrome).
3. The browser will display a page with the heading "Hello, World! Program".

### Step 4: View the Output in the Console
1. Open the browser’s Developer Tools:
   - On Chrome: Right-click the page, select **Inspect**, or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac).
   - Go to the **Console** tab.
2. You should see "Hello, World!" in the console.
3. If you don’t see it, check for typos in the code or ensure the file was saved.

### Step 5 (Optional): Display Output on the Web Page
1. To show "Hello, World!" directly on the page, modify the `<script>` section in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script>
       document.write("Hello, World!");
   </script>
   ```
2. Save the file and refresh the browser (`F5` or `Ctrl+R`).
3. The text "Hello, World!" will appear on the web page below the heading.

## Method 2: Running "Hello, World!" with Node.js
This method runs JavaScript outside a browser using Node.js, displaying output in a terminal.

### Step 1: Install Node.js
1. Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the "LTS" version (e.g., 20.17.0 as of now).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts (accept defaults).
3. Verify installation:
   - Open a terminal:
     - Windows: Press `Win+R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
     - Mac: Open Terminal from Applications > Utilities.
     - Linux: Open your terminal app.
   - Type `node -v` and press Enter.
   - You should see a version number (e.g., `v20.17.0`). If not, reinstall Node.js.

### Step 2: Create a JavaScript File
1. Open your text editor and create a new file named `hello.js`.
2. Add the following code:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```
3. Save the file in your folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\JS_Tutorial`).

### Step 3: Run the Program
1. Open a terminal and navigate to your folder:
   - Type `cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\JS_Tutorial` (adjust the path as needed) and press Enter.
   - Verify you’re in the right folder by typing `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac/Linux) to see `hello.js`.
2. Run the program:
   - Type `node hello.js` and press Enter.
   - You should see "Hello, World!" printed in the terminal.

## Troubleshooting
- **Browser Console Empty**:
  - Ensure the `<script>` tag is correct and the file is saved.
  - Reload the page (`F5`) and check the Console tab.
- **Node.js Error: "node is not recognized"**:
  - Reinstall Node.js and ensure it’s added to your system’s PATH.
  - Restart your terminal or computer.
- **File Not Found**:
  - Check that `hello.js` is in the folder and the terminal is in the correct directory (`dir` or `ls` to confirm).
- **Typos**:
  - JavaScript is case-sensitive. Ensure `console.log` is written exactly as shown.

## Experiment
- Change the message in `console.log("Hello, World!");` to something like `console.log("Hi, I’m learning JavaScript!");` and rerun.
- In the browser, try `alert("Hello, World!");` to show a pop-up (replace `console.log`).
- Add multiple lines, like:
  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, World!");
  console.log("This is my first program!");
  ```

## What You’ve Learned
- How to write a simple JavaScript program.
- Two ways to run JavaScript: in a browser (via HTML) and with Node.js (via terminal).
- How to use `console.log()` to display output.
- Basic debugging (checking for typos, verifying file paths).

## Next Steps
- Explore variables: `let message = "Hello, World!"; console.log(message);`
- Learn basic operators (e.g., `+`, `-`) and functions.
