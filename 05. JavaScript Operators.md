# 5. JavaScript Operators and Arithmetic operators

JavaScript operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. They allow you to manipulate data and perform computations in your JavaScript code. JavaScript operators can be categorized into several types, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and more. Here, I'll provide an overview of the most common types of JavaScript operators:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)
   - `%` (Modulus, returns the remainder)
   - `++` (Increment by 1)
   - `--` (Decrement by 1)

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   let y = 5;
   let sum = x + y;
   let remainder = x % y;
   x++; // Increment 'x' by 1
   y--; // Decrement 'y' by 1
   ```

2. **Comparison Operators:**
   - `==` (Equal to)
   - `!=` (Not equal to)
   - `===` (Strict equal to)
   - `!==` (Strict not equal to)
   - `>` (Greater than)
   - `<` (Less than)
   - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
   - `<=` (Less than or equal to)

   ```javascript
   let a = 10;
   let b = 5;
   let isEqual = a === b;
   let isGreaterThan = a > b;
   ```

3. **Logical Operators:**
   - `&&` (Logical AND)
   - `||` (Logical OR)
   - `!` (Logical NOT)

   ```javascript
   let isTrue = true;
   let isFalse = false;
   let result = isTrue && isFalse; // Logical AND
   result = isTrue || isFalse; // Logical OR
   result = !isTrue; // Logical NOT
   ```

4. **Assignment Operators:**
   - `=` (Assignment)
   - `+=` (Add and assign)
   - `-=` (Subtract and assign)
   - `*=` (Multiply and assign)
   - `/=` (Divide and assign)
   - `%=` (Modulus and assign)

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   x += 5; // Equivalent to x = x + 5
   x -= 3; // Equivalent to x = x - 3
   ```

5. **Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator):**
   - `condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false`

   ```javascript
   let age = 20;
   let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
   ```

6. **String Concatenation Operator:**
   - `+` (Used to concatenate strings)

   ```javascript
   let firstName = "John";
   let lastName = "Doe";
   let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
   ```

7. **Typeof Operator:**
   - `typeof` (Used to check the data type of a value)

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   let type = typeof x; // Returns "number"
   ```

8. **Comma Operator:**
   - `,` (Used to separate expressions, and it returns the result of the last expression)

   ```javascript
   let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
   let result = (a++, b++, c++); // result will be 3
   ```

These are some of the most commonly used JavaScript operators. Understanding how to use these operators is crucial for performing various operations in JavaScript, from basic arithmetic calculations to more complex logic and decision-making in your code.

## Assignment and Task
**Create a program that converts degree celsius to fahrenheit.
The formula to convert celsius to fahrenheit is
Formula: fahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32.
What you can do is store the value of celsius value in the celsius variable. Then use the formula fahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32 to convert celsius to fahrenheit and display the result.**
### Solution:
```js
let celcius = 88;
let fahrenheit = celcius * 1.8 + 32;
console.log(`${celcius} celcius equals to ${fahrenheit} fahrenheit`);
```
**Output**
```
88 celcius equals to 190.4 fahrenheit
```
