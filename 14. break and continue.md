# 14. break and continue

## JavaScript `break` and `continue` Statements

### `break` Statement:

The `break` statement is used in JavaScript to exit a loop prematurely. It is often used when a certain condition is met, and you want to stop the loop's execution immediately.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (/* condition */) {
        break;
    }
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

- The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate, and the program continues with the code outside the loop.

### Example 1: Using `break` in a `for` loop

In this example, we use the `break` statement to exit a `for` loop when the value of `i` becomes 5.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    if (i === 5) {
        break;
    }
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

The loop stops executing when `i` is equal to 5 due to the `break` statement.

### `continue` Statement:

The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. It's helpful when you want to skip specific elements or conditions in the loop without terminating it entirely.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (/* condition */) {
        continue;
    }
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

- The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop.

### Example 2: Using `continue` in a `for` loop

In this example, we use the `continue` statement to skip printing numbers divisible by 3 in a `for` loop.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
        continue;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
4
5
7
8
10
```

The `continue` statement skips the numbers that are divisible by 3, allowing the loop to continue with the next iteration.

### Example 3: Using `break` in a `while` loop

Here's an example of using the `break` statement to exit a `while` loop when a certain condition is met.

```javascript
let number = 1;
while (number <= 10) {
    console.log(number);
    if (number === 7) {
        break;
    }
    number++;
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

The `break` statement is used to exit the `while` loop when `number` becomes 7.

### Example 4: Using `continue` in a `while` loop

In this example, the `continue` statement is used within a `while` loop to skip the even numbers (divisible by 2) and print the odd numbers.

```javascript
let number = 1;
while (number <= 10) {
    if (number % 2 === 0) {
        number++;
        continue;
    }
    console.log(number);
    number++;
}
```

Output:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

The `continue` statement skips even numbers, allowing the loop to print only the odd numbers.

Both the `break` and `continue` statements are valuable tools in controlling the flow of loops in JavaScript, enabling you to exit loops prematurely or skip specific iterations as needed. These statements can help you write more efficient and precise code when working with loops in your JavaScript programs.

## for loop without break Example
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```
**Output**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
***
## for loop with break Example
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    break;
}
```
**Output**
```
1
```
***
## break with specific condition
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```
**Output**
```
1
2
```
***
## break with while
```js
while (true) {
    let number = parseFloat(prompt("Enter a number: "));
    if (number < 0) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(number);
}
```
**Output**
```
Enter a number: 5
5
Enter a number: 9
9
Enter a number: -4
-4
```
***
### continue Statement
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
 
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;
    }

    console.log(i);
}
```
**Output**
```
1
2
4
5
```
## break and continue with while
```js
while (true) {
    let number = parseFloat(prompt("Enter a number: "));
    if (number < 0) {
        break;
    }
    if (number % 2 != 0) {
      continue;
    }

    console.log(number);
}
```
**Output**
```
Enter a number: 4
4
Enter a number: 9
Enter a number: 28
28
Enter a number: -34
```
## Assignment and Task
**Can you create a program that takes the input from the user. If the user enters a prime number, print the prime number. If the user enters a negative or non-prime number, ask the user for another number. And when the user enters a number greater than 100, terminate the loop.**
### Solution:
```js
while (true) {
    let number = parseFloat(prompt("Enter a number: "));
    if(number > 100) {
        break;
    }
    
    let isPrime = true;
    for (let i = 2; i < number; i++) {
        if (number % i == 0) {
            isPrime = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    if (number < 0 || !isPrime) {
        continue;
    }
    
    else if (isPrime) {
    	console.log(number);
    }
}
```
**Output**
```
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 8
Enter a number: 11
Enter a number: 111
5
11
```
